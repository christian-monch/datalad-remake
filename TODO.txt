- Provide a way to overwrite the root dataset version during `datalad get`.
  This could be done via a config variable or an option that is used when
  creating the annex remote.

- Implement opportunistic collection of all results of a single computation
  that are not yet present (via `git annex reinject`).

- Consolidate compute-URL construction and splitting code

- Use dataclass for compute_info in annex remote

- Implement locking for result collection
